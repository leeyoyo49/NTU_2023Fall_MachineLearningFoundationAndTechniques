# NTU_2023Fall_HTML

Course in National Taiwan University 2023 fall, Professor Hsuan-Tien Lin's course on Machine Learning Foundation.

An amazing course on the basics and mathematical foundation of the machine learning world, very intense mathematical background needed for this course, calculus, algebra, statistics, probability are oftenly used in this course.

However, prof. Lin do manages to lecture the hard mathematics proofs in an easy and understandable way. :)

Qusetions for each homework is marked as _Q, and my solutions as _Sol.

The solutoin for hw1's coding is not coded right, so is best for anyone seeing this repo not copying it.

But the rest are pretty much fine, some minor mistakes only.

---

## Hw1 
Learning Problems, Perceptron Learning Algorithm, and a lot of PLA

## Hw2
Hoeffding Inequalities, VC dimensions, Decision Stump

## Hw3
Noise and Error, Linear Regression, Linear Models, Multinomial Logistic Regressions

## Hw4
Harder Binary Linear Classifications, Overfitting, Learning Principles

## Hw5
Hard-margin SVM, SVM kernels, Soft-margin SVM, SVM Duality

## Hw6
More on SVM, Blending and Bagging, ADA boost, Gradient boosting, Neural Network, Decision trees, Random Forests.

## Final Project
Predicting the number of Ubikes in each stations in Taipei city for each hour. Got some pretty decent result.
